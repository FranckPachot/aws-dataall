# **Pipelines**

Different business units might have their own data lake and ingest and process the data with very different tools:
Scikit Learn, Spark, SparkML, AWS SageMaker, AmazonAthenaâ€¦ The diversity of tools and use-cases result in a
wide variety of CICD standards which discourages development collaboration.

In order to distribute data ingestion and processing, data.all introduces data.all pipelines:

- data.all takes care of CICD infrastructure
- data.all integrates with <a href="https://awslabs.github.io/aws-ddk/">AWS DDK</a>, a tool to help you build data workflows in AWS
- data.all allows you to define development environments directly from the UI and deploys data pipelines to those AWS accounts

!!! success "Focus on value-added code"
      data.all takes care of the CICD and multi-environment configuration and DDK provides reusable assets and data constructs that accelerate the deployment of AWS data workflows,
      so you can focus on writing the actual transformation code and generating value from your data!


## Multi-environment Pipelines
In some cases, enterprises decide to separate CICD resources from data application resources, which at the same time, need to be deployed to multiple accounts.
Data.all allows users to easily define their CICD environment and other infrastructure environments in a flexible, robust way.

Let's see it with an example. In your enterprise, the Research team has 3 AWS accounts: Research-CICD, Research-DEV and Research-PROD. They want to ingest data with a data pipeline that is written in Infrastructure-As-Code
in the Research-CICD account. The actual data pipeline is deployed in 2 data accounts. First, in Research-DEV for development and testing and once it is ready it is deployed to Research-PROD.


### Pre-requisites
As a pre-requisite, Research-DEV and Research-PROD accounts need to be bootstrapped trusting the CICD account (`-a` parameter) and setting the stage of the AWS account, the environment id, with the  `e` parameter. Assuming 111111111111 = CICD account the commands are as follows:

- In Research-CICD (111111111111): `ddk bootstrap -e cicd`
- In Research-DEV (222222222222): `ddk bootstrap -e dev -a 111111111111`
- In Research-PROD (333333333333): `ddk bootstrap -e prod -a 111111111111`

In data.all we need to link the AWS accounts to the platform by creating 3 data.all Environments: Research-CICD Environment, Research-DEV Environment and Research-PROD Environment.

### Creating a pipeline
data.all pipelines are created from the UI, under Pipelines. We need to fill the creation form with the following information:

- Name, Description and tags
- CICD Environment: AWS account and region where the CICD resources will be deployed.
- Team, this is the Admin team of the pipeline. It belongs to the specified CICD Environment where the pipeline is defined as IaC
- Development strategy: 

Finally, we need to add **Development environments**. These are the AWS accounts and regions where the infrastructure defined in the CICD pipeline
is deployed. 

!!! warning "environment ID = data.all environment stage"
      When creating the pipeline and adding development environments, you define the stage of the environment. The bootstrap `e` parameter needs to match the one that you define in the data.all UI.
      In our example, we bootstraped with the parameters "dev" and "prod" and then we defined the stages as "dev" and "prod" correspondingly.

### CDK pipelines - Trunk-based

This CodePipeline pipeline is based on the [CDK Pipelines library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.pipelines/README.html)
As stated in the documentation, CDK Pipelines is an opinionated construct library. It is purpose-built to deploy one or more copies of your CDK applications using CloudFormation with a minimal amount of effort on your part.

#### CodeCommit repository

When a pipeline is created, a CloudFormation stack is deployed in the CICD environment AWS account. 
It contains an AWS CodeCommit repository with the code of an AWS DDK application set up for a multi-account deployment,
as explained in its [documentation](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-ddk/release/latest/how-to/multi-account-deployment.html).


In the deployed repository, data.all pushes a `ddk.json` file with the details of the selected development environments:

```json
{
    "environments": {
        "cicd": {
            "account": "111111111111",
            "region": "eu-west-1"
        },
        "dev": {
            "account": "222222222222",
            "region": "eu-west-1",
            "resources": {
                "ddk-bucket": {"versioned": false, "removal_policy": "destroy"}
            }
        },
        "prod": {
            "account": "333333333333",
            "region": "eu-west-1",
            "resources": {
                "ddk-bucket": {"versioned": true, "removal_policy": "retain"}
            }
        }
    }
}
```
In addition, the `app.py` file is also written accordingly to the development environments selected in data.all UI.

```

```
#### CICD deployment
data.all backend performs the first deployment of the CICD stack defined in the CodeCommit repository. The result is a
CloudFormation template deploying a CICD pipeline having the aforementioned CodeCommit repository as source.
This CodePipeline pipeline is based on the [CDK Pipelines library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.pipelines/README.html)

### CodePipeline pipelines - Trunk-based or GitFlow

For cases in which we need more control  over the CICD pipeline, instead of using [CDK Pipelines library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.pipelines/README.html) we can
use `aws-codepipeline` construct library directly. 


#### CodeCommit repository and CICD deployment
When a pipeline is created, a CloudFormation stack is deployed in the CICD environment AWS account. 
It contains an AWS CodeCommit repository with the code of an AWS DDK application set up for a multi-account deployment,
as explained in its [documentation](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-ddk/release/latest/how-to/multi-account-deployment.html).

In addition, the CloudFormation stack also contains the CICD CodePipeline pipeline that deploys the application. 



!!!abstract "GitFlow and branches"
      If you selected GitFlow as development strategy, you probably notices that the CodePipelines for non-prod stages fail in the first run because they cannot find their source.
      After the first successful run of the prod-CodePipeline pipeline, just create branches in the CodeCommit repository for the other stages and you are ready to go.

## Which development strategy should I choose?

**CDK pipelines - Trunk-based**

1. The `CDK-pipelines` construct handles cross-account deployments seamlessly and robustly. Instead of assuming roles for deployment, it deploys CloudFormation stacks already synthesized.
2. It also allows developers to modify the CICD stack as it is self-mutating. It allows them to add monitoring, tests, manual approvals directly in the repository.

**CodePipeline pipelines - Trunk-based or GitFlow**

1. The `aws-codepipelines` construct uses AWS CodePipelines directly. We are able to define any type of CICD architecture, such as in this case Trunk-based and GitFlow.
2. Developers working on the pipeline cannot modify the CICD pipeline
3. Cross-account deployments

**Summary**
CDK pipelines are recommended from a cross-account deployment point of view, whereas CodePipeline pipelines are recommended if you need to provide an immutable pipeline architecture or if you want to implement a GitFlow strategy.
